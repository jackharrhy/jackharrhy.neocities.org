big snow day leads to big cup of cream of earl grey

same tea as last log, but this time, not even a dash of milk in it, it stands very strongly on its own!

this is in an ikea mug i picked up, in _ikea_ during my last trip to the UK in June of this last summer ('23), it is a very nice mug

_looking forward_ to stepping out into the winter wonderland to deal with the snow problem sometime soon, but for now i remain on my couch with another load of tea to sip through, listening to Cocteau Twins and watching [a long play video of someone driving to Mount Fuji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naz_RVh48vg)

i'm a really big fan of [slow television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_television) and dreamy / ambient music while i do another task, tea of course goes wonderful with these tasks as well

**9/10**
