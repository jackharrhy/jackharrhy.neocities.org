![glass teapot, with infuser, containing steeped white tea, therefore the water is a warm yellow glow, infront of the kettle is a singular glass mug, which white tea has been poured into](/assets/tea-log/24-07-2023/tea.jpg)

had the glass teapot for some time now, and i am a big fan of it

most days it sees some usage just as the day is ending, usually brewing some uncle lees white tea

i have found that when i first started brewing with this infuser, i wanted to double teabag it up to have a stronger tasting tea,
but i have moved away from wanting that, and am now content with just a singular teabag

my coworker keenan usually joins me for end of day teatime, it has become a good ritual

not 9/10 out of 10, due to it no longer being a novelty, just a decent cuppa white tea

**8/10**
