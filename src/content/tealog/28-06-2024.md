simple tetley tea in the lemon mug for today

up late working on some preparatory learning for an upcoming game jam happening exactly a week today

weather has been warmer as of late, so having a warm tea mid-day has been off the table most days

therefore having late night tea when its cool out is best tea time at the minute

i love the lemon mug, it is a basin of tea

**8/10**
