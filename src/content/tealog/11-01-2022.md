![green rimmed glass mug of tea, sitting on desk, with a blurred lemon loaf visible behind the tea, square aspect ratio](/assets/tea-log/11-01-2022/tea.jpg)

first tea log!

i made a nice little tetley tea in a glass mug i was gifted for christmas by leah

we just had sun sushi, and stopped by starbucks

since i'm not a starbucks tea enjoyer, i grabbed a lemon loaf, as seen in the blurred background above

overall, good tea, and very good combination with the lemon loaf

**8/10**
